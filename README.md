# A-Tentative-Dive-into-Orbits
An attempt of mine to simulate a realistic orbit. This specific animation deals with the inner planet of the Proxima Centauri system (yes, that red circle is meant to be Proxima Centauri). 
The animation should follow Kepler's second law, meaning it speeds up the closer it gets to its star and slows down the further it gets. Due to the eccentricity I chose, it might not be too apparent!
